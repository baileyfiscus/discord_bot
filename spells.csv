For example, the flames created by a Wall of Fire are suppressed within the Sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.\n\nSpells: Any active spell or other magical Effect on a creature or an object in the Sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.\n\nMagic Items: The Properties and powers of Magic Items are suppressed in the Sphere. For example, a +1 long sword in the Sphere functions as a nonmagical long sword. A magic weapon's Properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the Sphere or wielded by an attacker in the Sphere.

You can choose from any of the following Effects when you cast this spell. As an action on Your Turn, you can repeat the same Effect or choose a different one.\n\nFlood: You cause the water level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the wave's path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of capsizing. The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose a different Effect. If this Effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start of your next turn while the flood Effect lasts.\n\nPart Water: You cause water in the area to move apart and create a Trench. The Trench extends across the spell's area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The Trench remains until the spell ends or you choose a different Effect. The water then slowly fills in the Trench over the course of the next round until the normal water level is restored.\n\nRedirect Flow: You cause flowing water in the area to move in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over Obstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely Directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the spell's area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain Conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose until the spell ends or you choose a different Effect.\n\nWhirlpool: This Effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn't caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage, this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex."

"Glyph Of Warding"	"3"	"abjuration"	"False"	"1 hour"	"Touch"	"True"	"True"	"True"	"Incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumes"	"False"	"Until dispelled or triggered"	"Bard, Cleric, Wizard"	"When you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other creatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of floor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a book, a scroll, or a Treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place, if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken and the spell ends without being triggered.\n\nThe glyph is nearly Invisible and requires a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.\n\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering the glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or manipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most Common triggers include opening that object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or seeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell ends.\n\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under certain circumstances or according to Physical Characteristics (such as height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect Aberrations or drow), or Alignment. You can also set Conditions for creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.\n\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a spell glyph.\n\nExplosive Runes: When triggered, the glyph erupts with magical energy in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on the glyph. The Sphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the aura must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice when you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful one.\n\nSpell Glyph: You can store a prepared spell of 3rd Level or lower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The spell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being stored has no immediate Effect when cast in this way. When the glyph is triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target, it Targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell affects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell summons Hostile creatures or creates harmful Objects or traps, they appear as close as possible to the intruder and Attack it. If the spell requires Concentration, it lasts until the end of its full Duration.\n\nAt Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th Level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes glyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create a spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same level as the slot you use for the glyph of warding."

"Seen Casually" is some place you have seen more than once but with which you aren't very familiar. "Viewed Once" is a place you have seen once, possibly using magic. "Description" is a place whose Location and Appearance you know through someone else's description, perhaps from a map.\n\n"False Description" is a place that doesn't exist.

For example, if you tried to Travel 120 miles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as north-east, 3 as east, and so on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a Coastal city and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.\n\nSimilar Area: You and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that's visually or thematically similar to the target area.

Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.\n\nMishap: The spell's unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey.

You don't need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly Components. The spell simply takes Effect. Alternatively, you can create one of the following Effects of your choice.\n\n• You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn't a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\n\n• You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all Hit Points, and you end all Effects on them described in the Greater Restoration spell.\n\n• You grant up to ten creatures that you can see Resistance to a damage type you choose.\n\n• You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical Effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich's Life Drain Attack.\n\n• You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent's successful save, a foe's critical hit, or a friend's failed save.

This spell might simply fail, the Effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item's current owner.\n\nThe Stress of casting this spell to produce any Effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you.
